		<details>
			<summary><b>Umer, please tell us all about yourself !</b></summary>
			<p>I started using computers at a very early age. I loved to play games and modify OS files. I loved reading computer books in 2nd grade. I knew how to code in GW-basic in 3rd grade. I knew how to code in Visual Basic in 5th Grade. My father bought me all kinds of Computer books for me to read. I developed multiple software and then I started to code in C++. I was offered an Internship in 9th Grade where I worked on Game Dev, Web Dev and Flash Animations. That was the point where I knew that the purpose of my life was something more than to get a good job in my life.</p>

			<p>I won multiple National Events in Computer Science Category. Having special interest in Robotics, I have represented my country at many International Events that include ABU Robocon 2010 to 2012. I am the Mentor of many Teams that represented Pakistan at First Lego League (FLL) and First Global League (FGL). Apart from that, I find myself and extremely proficient instructor while I have delivered more than 100+ workshop across the country.</p>

			<p>I am the Co-Founder of Robominors and Technology Spirits. Robominors is a social-entrepreneurship setup where the cause is much bigger than profit. It's about preparing the next generation kids for the industry, to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Robominors is a STEM/STEAM-based Academy where we offer specially designed courses for young mindsets like Building and Programming Robots, Programming in C++, Python, Arduino, DIY Science, and Arts, Microbits, Web Development, Internet of Things and many courses. The idea behind Robominors is very close to my heart as it reminds me of my early childhood and how my father inspired and motivated me to be there where I am today.</p>
